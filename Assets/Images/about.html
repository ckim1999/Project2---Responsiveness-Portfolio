            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>
                Hi my name is Christopher Kim. I am currently 21 years old and attending Columbia University Computer Bootcamp. I took this course to learn more about computer for myself and to consider computer development as a career choice. In my free time I enjoy playing league of legends or hanging out with friends on discord.

            <h3>Background in Computers</h3>
            <p>
              My interest in computers began during my senior year of high school where I took a coding class using Python, but I didn't have the drive to study it at the time. The time to register for a college was coming which meant I had to pick a major which was either accounting or computers. I ultimately chose to study computers because it was a safe and secure way of maintaining a career in the computer field, but I struggled to motivate myself feeling that I made a wrong career choice. Some time later I decided to try out accounting it was manageable, but it wasn't something that I wanted to do full-time. The following semester I took a computer course, but due to covid it was virtual and i didn't feel that the course was teaching as well as if it was in person. Then I found this program and I'm trying to find motivation in being a developer.
